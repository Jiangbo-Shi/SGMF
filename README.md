# A Structure-aware Hierarchical Graph-based Multiple Instance Learning Framework for pT Staging in Histopathological Image ([TMI 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10119190))

## Abstract 
Pathological primary tumor (pT) stage fo- cuses on the infiltration degree of the primary tumor to surrounding tissues, which relates to the prognosis and treatment choices. The pT staging relies on the field-of- views from multiple magnifications in the gigapixel images, which makes pixel-level annotation difficult. Therefore, this task is usually formulated as a weakly supervised whole slide image (WSI) classification task with the slide-level label. Existing weakly-supervised classification methods mainly follow the multiple instance learning paradigm, which takes the patches from single magnification as the instances and extracts their morphological features inde- pendently. However, they cannot progressively represent the contextual information from multiple magnifications, which is critical for pT staging. Therefore, we propose a structure-aware hierarchical graph-based multi-instance learning framework (SGMF) inspired by the diagnostic pro- cess of pathologists. Specifically, a novel graph-based in- stance organization method is proposed, namely structure- aware hierarchical graph (SAHG), to represent the WSI. Based on that, we design a novel hierarchical attention- based graph representation (HAGR) network to capture the critical patterns for pT staging by learning cross-scale spa- tial features. Finally, the top nodes of SAHG are aggregated by a global attention layer for bag-level representation. Ex- tensive studies on three large-scale multi-center pT staging datasets with two different cancer types demonstrate the effectiveness of SGMF, which outperforms state-of-the-art up to 5.6% in the F1 score.
